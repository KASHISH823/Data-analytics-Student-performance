# Data-analytics-Student-performance
A Student Performance Analytics Dashboard built in Python. It analyzes marks, attendance, and logins to find top &amp; struggling students, study absenteeism impact, and provide insights using charts and heatmaps.
# 🎓 Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data (marks, attendance, and logins) to identify trends, correlations, and at-risk students.  
It highlights top vs struggling students and visualizes key factors that impact academic performance.  
The aim is to help institutions take early actions to improve student outcomes.  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **StudentID** → Unique ID for each student  
- **Marks** → Exam scores  
- **Attendance** → Attendance percentage  
- **Logins** → Number of times students logged into the learning platform
  
## 🔎 Analysis Performed
1. Calculated **averages** of marks, attendance, and logins.  
2. Found **correlations** between marks, attendance, and logins.  
3. Analyzed the **impact of absenteeism** on student performance.  
4. Identified **top and struggling students**.  
5. **Visualized** the data using:  
   - Bar Charts  
   - Heatmaps  
   - Correlation plots  
   - Scatter plots (Attendance vs Marks)
     
## 📊 Key Insights
- Students with **higher attendance** generally scored better.  
- **Frequent logins** showed a positive correlation with performance.  
- Some students with high attendance but **low marks** need additional academic support.  
- Absenteeism strongly affects grades.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas** (data cleaning & manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (visualization)  
- **NumPy** (numerical analysis)  

Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook student_performance.ipynb
Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

📌 Future Improvements
Add machine learning model to predict student success/failure.
Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit/Plotly.
Expand dataset with more student features (assignments, extracurricular, etc).
